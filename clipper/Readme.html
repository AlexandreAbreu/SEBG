<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>The code in this extension is a modified version of
a chrome extension that I found on the net (and a blog)
article. The name of the extension was:

<pre>
    "name": "Linx Bookmark 1.1",
    "description": "Adds the current page to the Linx bookmarking system.",
    "version": "1.1",
</pre>
    

<p>Unfortunately I cannot give a more precise reference, and 
    have not been able to find the original. Mail my if you stumble over
    the origonal.


<p>Some the code in content_script.js
came from <a href="http://dev.day.com/content/ddc/blog/2010/06.html">
